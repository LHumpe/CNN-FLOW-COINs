# A Convolutional-Neural-Network for the Facial Recognition of the Emotional State of Flow
This repository contains code which was used to detect the emotional state of flow using facial emotion recognition. This was done for a Seminar, namely: Collaborative Innovation Networks. We utilized transfer learning by fine-tuning the popular ResNet-50 architecture which we trained on self-labeled YouTube videos of live performing musicians. Apart from the fact that data labeling can turn into a decade-taking nightmare this was maybe one of the most interesting projects so far. Even though we did not design a new network architecture, working on this data science from the raw beginning to the whole end was a very valuable experience. 

Since grading is in progress and since we are planning to write a scientific paper the submitted is not available to the public yet. If you are interested in reading it you can just leave me a <input id=username type="text" placeholder="github username or repo link">
<button onclick="fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username.value.replace(/^.*com[/]([^/]*).*$/,'$1')}/events/public`).then(e=> e.json()).then(e => [...new Set([].concat.apply([],e.filter(x => x.type==='PushEvent').map(x => x.payload.commits.map(c => c.author.email)))).values()]).then(x => results.innerText = x)">MESSAGE</button>
